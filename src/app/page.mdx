### About

Programmer, engineer, husband and socialist.

My name is Tristan and sometimes I document the things I do. I'm awful at it.

Originally from [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane). I earned a bachelor's degree from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/) where I learned and built the full computing stack: microchips, circuits, computers, operating systems, drivers and programs. I started a PhD in sport science but the call of industry paid so much better.

I took the jump and landed in the USA in 2013, married my wife. After a number of small startups I eventually landed at [Monetate](https://monetate.com/) and [Tripleseat](https://tripleseat.com/).

As of late 2024 I'm taking a sabbatical after working for a full 10+ years and I kinda need a break. I even made this website!
