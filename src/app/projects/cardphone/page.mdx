The **CardPhone** is an attempt at a minimalist, credit card sized cellphone
with that really can fit in your wallet or purse. It is a Rolodex REX with
modern functionality: lithium-based batteries, nanometer level silicon,
wireless communications, solid-state memory, MEMS sensors and an 
electrophoretic display.

known as WebAssembly (WASM).

There is an existing phone in the space that has similar specifications: the
