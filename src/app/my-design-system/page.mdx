I've worked with a lot of design systems over the years, some more coherant 
than others but they've all been labors of love. From now on I'm going to refer
to design systems as libraries for the sake of brevity.

### Components

Before React, libaries largely used CSS classes and overrides to style html
elements and jQuery to add customized behaviour and effects. It was hell. (Some
More Words on how it was hell). Thanks to us computer touchers, we can 
encapsulate style, behaviour and effects into one or more discrete and easily
compilable files which makes maintenance so very much easier. It has been a sea
change in how web development is done (unless you're in enterprise, for which I
will pray for your soul). There is a bevy of libraries available to developers
today that caters to any kind of website.

### What are Websites

There are basically N types of websites being used by the majority of homo
sapiens today in TYOOL202X:
1. Aggregators: list based where users scroll through articles of content
2. Content-Driven: TBA

		<h3>Atomic Design</h3>

		About a decade ago Brad Frost wrote what I think is a seminal book in UI Development called [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) (you can read it in full online here, treat yourself). Frost posits that if you follow the ethos of _Atomic_, you will be able to build and maintain your own design system all with less labor needed which I think we can all appreciate as developers. There are some humanistic parts which aren't applicable to my design system of a single developer of a low traffic personal website so I wont cover them here (for now) but if you have a team that struggles with a design language for the product they regularly work on it is worth reading.

		The central thesis is that you can break a **Page** into even more divisible parts:
		- **Atoms** are the most indivsible component that exists and is probably just a html element (inputs, buttons and images etc)
		- **Molecules** are components that consist of a few Atoms, like a search component or a form input with label
		- **Organisms** are complex groupings of Molecules that belong together, like a site header
		- **Templates** are groups of organisms and molecules that are commonly used across multiple pages in your web application where reuse makes sense

Of course I'm absolutely brutalizing the source material, but all in all it's a very relatable system for React/Component developers who are used to breaking up designs into more discrete components as needed.

### My Design System (MDS)

The over-arching requirements for MDS was *"make it simple and make it for 90% of needs"*. It's a really great thought/development exercise because everyone has a different interpretation of what a "good" system is.
